# NVIDIA's PM342 control scripts search for devices with matching USB vendor
# and device ID, then check each to verify if it matches the requested serial
# number. If a USB device node isn't r/w for the user running the script,
# the device can be enumerated, but the serial number can't be queried. The
# PM342 scripts (or libftdi/libusb called by them) treat this as an error,
# which stops the script from looking for further PM342 devices. This will
# sometimes prevent the scripts seeing a PM342, even if that specific device
# has permissions that allow the serial number to be read. Fix this by opening
# the permissions for all PM342 devices.
